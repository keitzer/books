# Alex Ogorek's Book List

## All books in this list are linked to Amazon for easy purchase with just 1 click (NOT affiliate links. Amazon shut down my account lol) :)

<br>

### Note: üåü ones are favorites for the year; cream of the crop. (especially considering the books I read are already the best of the best)


### Also: üåüüåü are considered‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ the ‚Äú11 out of 10‚Äù so to speak. Should you see any of these on the list, read them immediately. If you already have, I‚Äôm sure you agree with my opinion.
<br>

### This list also gets updated as I read books‚Ä¶ which means this is a fluid / living document.
### Check back every few weeks to see the new books (the bottom of the list) :)
<br>

### Feel free to suggest ones to me: [alex@alexogorek.com](mailto:alex@alexogorek.com)
