# Alex Ogorek's Book List

## All books in this list are linked to Amazon for easy purchase with just 1 click (so you don’t have to search for the title yourself) :)

<br>

### Note: 🌟 ones are favorites for the year; cream of the crop. (especially considering the books I read are already the best of the best)

### Also: 🌟🌟 are considered… well… the “11 out of 10” so to speak. Should you see any of these on the list, read them immediately. If you already have, I’m sure you agree with my opinion.


### This list also gets updated as I read books… which means this is a fluid / living document.
### Check back every few weeks to see the new books (the bottom of the list) :)

### Feel free to suggest ones to me: ogorek.alex@gmail.com

# 2015
## Goal: Read/Listen to 50 books for the year (aka, about 1 book per week on average). Actual: 70
These are the books I read for 2015. They are in order starting around 20-something. Before that, the list was not created so the order is unknown.
